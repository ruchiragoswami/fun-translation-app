# Fun Translation App

The aim of this project was to practise my vanillaJS skills. 

Skills practiced: attaching events to HTML elements, taking user input in browser, querySlector(), showing output in browser, making network calls to get relevant data, error handling network calls. 

Similar app, called minion translation was also made before this.
